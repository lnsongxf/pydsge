# pydsge
DSGE parser in Python
====
A simple Python (3+) package for Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.

This originally is a fork of Ed Herbst's fork from Pablo Winant's (excellent) package dolo. This version seemed slightly easier to adjust in order to obtain the matrices I need than in the up-to-date and more advanced version of dolo.

See [https://github.com/EconForge/dolo] and [https://github.com/eph].

I am using this as a parser to obtain a certain type of system matrices which are necessary for my algorithm to solve occasionally binding constraints.

Installation
------------
In the directory, run
```bash
pip install .
```
